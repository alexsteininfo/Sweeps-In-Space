# Selective sweep probabilities in spatially expanding populations
 
This repository provides code used in the manuscript "Selective sweep probabilities in spatially expanding populations" (**bioRxiv**, 2023). The paper can be found in [this link](https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.11.27.568915).

The code files are divided into three folders:
- **Supporting mathematica scripts** contains calculations with Mathematica.
- **Figures** contains code to analyse processed simulation data and generate figures
- **Analysis code** contains additional code to analyse rho simulation data

Simulations were run using the workflow **warlock**, which is based on the **demon** simulation framework. The code can be found at [https://github.com/AngryMaciek/warlock]{https://github.com/AngryMaciek/warlock} and [https://github.com/robjohnnoble/demon_model]{https://github.com/robjohnnoble/demon_model} respectively. Configuration files and simulated data can be downloaded from [https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10775383]{https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10775383}.
