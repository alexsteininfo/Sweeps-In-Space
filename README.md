# Selective sweep probabilities in spatially expanding populations
 
This repository provides codes that have been used in the paper "Selective sweep probabilities in spatially expanding populations" (**bioRxiv**, 2023). The paper can be found in [this link](https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.11.27.568915).

The code files are divided into two folders:
- **Supporting mathematica scripts** contains calculations with Mathematica.
- **Figures**  contains the code that has been used to analyse the simulated data and generate figures
