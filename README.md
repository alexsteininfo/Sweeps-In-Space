# Selective sweep probabilities in spatially expanding populations
 
This repository provides code used in the manuscript "Selective sweep probabilities in spatially expanding populations" (**bioRxiv**, 2023). The paper can be found in [this link](https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.11.27.568915).

The code files are divided into three folders:
- **Mathematica scripts** contains calculations with Mathematica.
- **Figures** contains code to analyse processed simulation data and generate figures.
- **Simulation analysis** contains code to extract information from simulation data.
- **Numerical integration** contains code for numerical integrations.
- **Convergence analysis** contains code to fit gamma distributions to sweep completion radii.

Simulations were run using the workflow **warlock**, which is based on the **demon** simulation framework. The code can be found at [https://github.com/AngryMaciek/warlock](https://github.com/AngryMaciek/warlock) and [https://github.com/robjohnnoble/demon_model](https://github.com/robjohnnoble/demon_model) respectively. Configuration files and simulated data can be downloaded from [https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10775383](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10775383).
